tools\
    CompileGCBMResults - Python script for turning raw SQLite output database from
        the model into a more user-friendly format that includes most of the
        indicators from CBM3 (NPP, NEP, pools, etc.).

    CompileGCBMSpatialOutput - Python script for turning raw GCBM spatial output
        into final TIFF layers.
        
    GCBM - The simulation model.

    Recliner2GCBM-[x86/x64] - Tool for preparing the SQLite input database for
        GCBM, which holds non-spatial (or coarse spatially-referenced) model
        parameters. Use the x64 version and fall back to the x86 version if you
        don't have the 64-bit MS Access driver installed.
        
        The tool has both a GUI version to guide you through the process the
        first time, and a command-line version to update a database from a saved
        configuration, provided that the columns in the input data have not
        changed.
        
    Tiler - Converts raster and vector layers into the format required by GCBM.

To run the project (the short version):

Set up your Python environment and make any necessary modifications to run_all.bat
as described in documentation\GCBM_Installation_Guide_2019_11_14.docx.

---

To run the project (the detailed version):
    Install Python 3:
        If you have Python 3 already installed:
            From the command prompt in tools\python_3_installer, type:
            install_modules_only (path to existing Python installation)
            
            For example, if your computer already has 64-bit Python 3 installed
            in c:\Python37:
            install_modules_only c:\Python37
    
        If you do not have Python 3 installed:
            From the command prompt in tools\python_3_installer, type:
            install_python
            
    If you do not have MS Access installed, you will need to install a driver in
    order to connect to MS Access databases. The driver can be found in:
    tools\python_3_installer\x64\AccessDatabaseEngine_x64.exe
    
    Install the Visual C++ Redistributable packages required to run the GCBM and
    related tools:
        tools\VC_redist\2008\vcredist_x64.exe
        tools\VC_redist\2013\vcredist_x64.exe
        tools\VC_redist\2015\VC_redist.x64.exe
        tools\VC_redist\2017\VC_redist.x64.exe
        
    Install the .NET framework 4.7.2 redistributable package required to run the
    Recliner2GCBM tool:
        tools\VC_redist\NDP472-KB4054530-x86-x64-AllOS-ENU.exe
            
    Edit run_all.bat and set the GCBM_PYTHON path and PLATFORM variables in the
    USER CONFIGURATION section near the top to the correct values for your system.

    Run run_all.bat, which performs the following preprocessing, simulation, and
    postprocessing steps:
    
    1) Run the tiler script
        - batch file runs \tools\Tiler\tiler.py
            - define all spatial layers needed for the simulation - can be
                raster or shapefile:
                - bounding box
                - age
                - classifiers
                - disturbance events (optional)
            - crops all layers to a bounding box and reprojects to WGS84
            - processes layers into GCBM tile/block/cell format
            - output is a number of zip files containing GCBM-format data plus
                a json file containing metadata and an optional attribute table

    2) Prepare the input database using Recliner2GCBM
        - runs the command-line version of Recliner2GCBM
            (\tools\Recliner2GCBM-[x86\x64]\Recliner2GCBM.exe) on the saved project
            configuration made by running the GUI tool (Recliner2GCBM-GUI.exe)
        - note: the paths in the saved recliner2gcbm_config.json file are relative
            to the location of the json file
        - output is a SQLite database: gcbm_input.db which contains all of the
            non-spatial data required to run the project - parameters taken from
            a CBM3 ArchiveIndex database: disturbance matrices, default climate
            data, etc.

    3) Update the GCBM configuration using tools\Tiler\update_gcbm_config.py -
        automatically updates the GCBM configuration files based on the tiled layers:
        - scans for all of the tiled layers and adds them to the provider
            configuration file
        - sets the tile, block, and cell size in the config files so that
            the model knows the overall resolution of the simulation (the
            lowest common denominator of all the tiled layer resolutions)
        - updates the list of disturbance layers in the simulation based on
            the DisturbanceLayer items in tiler.py
        - updates the initial classifier set with the classifier layers tagged
            in tiler.py

    4) Run the GCBM model: gcbm_project\run_gcbm.bat
        - project configuration is split between multiple files listed in
            gcbm_project\gcbm_config.cfg
        - data source configuration (spatial layers + SQLite) is in
            gcbm_project\provider_config.json

    5) Run the compile results script:
        \tools\compilegcbmresults\compilegcbmresults.bat
        - turns the raw GCBM output database into a more user-friendly format
            containing most of the familiar indicators from the CBM3 Toolbox
        - produces processed_output\compiled_gcbm_output.db

    6) Run the compile spatial output script:
        \tools\compilegcbmspatialoutput\create_tiffs.bat
        - generates tiff layers from raw GCBM spatial output
        - output is a tiff layer per indicator and timestep in processed_output\spatial
